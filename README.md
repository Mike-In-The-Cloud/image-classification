# Image Classification with Cifar10

This repository contains an investigation into machine learning, the pipeline required for data to be processed successfully, observations of different model structure and how results were used to improve the accuracy of a model. 

By learning techniques demonstrated during lectures throughout this module and then applying them to a dataset, ideally with an outcome
that has accuracy better than a random guess (50/50).

A full report has also been provided for this repository.
